## üìñ Overview  
**Bite-Me** is a fully functional and scalable restaurant management system designed to manage multiple branches with ease.  
It was developed as part of a group project for the *Engineering Methods for Software Systems Development* course during our third year.  

**Key Features:**  
- Multi-role system: Customers, HR, CEO, Branch Managers, Restaurant Managers.  
- Interactive GUI built with **JavaFX** (using Scene Builder).  
- Real-time notifications and reports.  
- Secure and optimized with **multi-threading**.

## üéØ Features  

### üîë User Roles  
| Role              | Key Features                                                                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customer**      | Place orders, track orders, receive notifications.                          |
| **Branch Manager**| Approve employees, create user accounts, manage permissions, view reports.  |
| **HR**            | Add new employees to the system.                                            |
| **CEO**           | Access reports for all branches, including performance data.                |

### üõ†Ô∏è General Features  
- **Secure Login System:** Role-based access for various users.  
- **Real-time Notifications:** Powered by Twilio for customer updates.  
- **PDF Reports:** Generate and download branch and performance reports (via iTextPDF).  
- **Automated Setup:** Initialize the database with basic data automatically.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Multi-threaded architecture for faster, concurrent operations.  
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track logged-in users and request activity.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Architecture  

### **Client-Server Communication**  
- The client sends structured requests, and the server handles database operations and returns responses.  
- Communication is facilitated by a custom `Message` class for structured data exchange.  

### **Server-Side Features**  
- **Concurrency:** Multi-threading allows the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously.  
- **Database Security:** Ensures safe operations to prevent data breaches.  

### **Database**  
- **MySQL:** Centralized storage for all user, order, and branch data.  
- Automated initialization for quick deployment.
